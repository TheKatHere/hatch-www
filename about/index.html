            Hatch is a third-party project hosting service for the Scratch
            programming language. Scratch is a great option to learn the
            fundamentals of programming, but it is designed for young children.
            Many Scratchers understandably find themselves outgrowing Scratch as
            they get older, and/or have distaste for new Scratch features, but
            they want to keep using the Scratch language. Hatch was designed
            with this group of users in mind. While we're very similar to
            Scratch, having a close online community, we have more relaxed
            rules.

          <div class="faqq">Why should I use Hatch?</div>
          <div class="faqa">
            There are other good third-party options for hosting Scratch
            projects. However, Hatch is far less limited. We are very
            transparent between the Hatch Team and Hatchlings (users), and our
            rules are much more relaxed. We also contain features that some
            other similar sites may not, such as commenting.

          <div class="faqq">Why don't you have an editor?</div>
          <div class="faqa">
            We haven't implemented an editor yet because we didn't see a huge
            need to add one immediately. Instead, you can make a project in the
            official
            <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/editor">Scratch Editor</a> or the
            third-party
            <a href="https://turbowarp.org/editor">TurboWarp Editor</a>, then
            upload the *.sb3 file to Hatch.

          <div class="faqq">
            Can I advertise Hatch or my Hatch Projects on Scratch?
          </div>
          <div class="faqa">
            No. Scratch has rules that prohibit sharing links to websites with
            looser moderation guidelines, because Scratch is a platform for
            users of all ages. Please do not share links to Hatch or mention
            Hatch anywhere on the Scratch website.
